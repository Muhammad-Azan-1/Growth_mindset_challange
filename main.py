# Creating a Image background removal 

#1. Libraries Used and Their Purpose

#? 1) streamlit is a Python library used to create interactive web applications with minimal effort.
import streamlit as st  


#? 2) rembg r is a powerful Python library used for background removal from images. It uses deep learning models to remove the background and return a transparent PNG.
from rembg import remove


#? 3) Pillow is a Python library for image processing that converts raw binary image data into an actual image object, allowing users to open, 
#? display, edit, and save images in various formats (JPEG, PNG, BMP, etc.). It provides tools for resizing, 
 #? cropping, filtering, format conversion, and other image manipulations.

#! Core Purpose of Pillow:
#? Pillow is used to open, edit, and save images in Python.
#? ‚úî Pillow converts binary image data into an actual image object that Python can process, display, and modify etc
#? ‚úî It allows us to modify images (crop, resize, remove background, etc.).
#? ‚úî Without it, uploaded images are just raw data that cannot be processed directly.
from PIL import Image 


#? 4) io.BytesIO The io module in Python provides an in-memory byte-stream class called BytesIO. This is used to temporarily store 
#? image data (binary data) in memory.
from io import BytesIO


#? 5)  base64 module is used for encoding binary data (like images) into text format.
#! Transmission Over Text-Based Systems:
#? Some systems (like HTML, JSON, and email) primarily handle text and may not support raw binary data.
#? Encoding allows binary files (like images) to be sent as text.
#? Storage in Text-Based Databases:
#? Some databases only store text data. Encoding allows us to store images and other binary files as strings

st.set_page_config(layout="wide", page_title="Image Background Remover") #? By default, Streamlit apps have a narrow layout, meaning content is displayed in a centered column with limited width.Setting layout="wide" makes the app use the full width of the screen, allowing content to stretch and making better use of available space.

#! first we have to decide what  maximum size of file user can upload to remove the background image

max_file_size = 5 * 1024 * 1024

#? converting MB to Btyes Since 1 MB = 1024 KB, and 1KB = 1024 Bytes so we will max allow the file size to be 5MB which is 5,242,880 btyes
#? in above  max_file_size we are converting file size from MB to bytes  because computers store and process data in Bytes, not MB.
#?When handling file uploads, most programming languages (including Python & Streamlit) measure file sizes in Bytes.

#! inside get_uploaded_image function

#! 1)
#? Image.open(image) is a function from the Pillow (PIL) library that opens an image file and loads it into a format 
#? that Python can work with.

#?  It reads the uploaded image file.
#?  It converts it into a Pillow Image object.
#?  You can now manipulate, edit, or display the image in Python.

#! 2)
#? col1 , col2 = st.columns(2) is a Streamlit layout function that creates two equal-width columns in your app. first colum content will be added using col1 same for col2
#? In Streamlit, col1 is likely a column created using st.columns(). It allows you to arrange elements side by side instead of 
#? stacking them vertically.

#? images are always stored as binary data, no matter the format (JPEG, PNG, BMP, etc.).




#! Python does understand binary data, but it cannot directly process or manipulate an image from raw binary data.

# Why Pillow is Needed:
# ‚úÖ Binary image data (from file upload) is just a stream of bytes.
# ‚úÖ Python can read binary data, but it doesn't "know" it's an image.
# ‚úÖ Pillow converts the binary data into an actual image object that Python can work with (display, edit, modify, etc.).

# üìå Without Pillow, Python only sees raw bytes, not an image.
# üìå Pillow acts as a translator, making the image usable in Python.

# üöÄ So, Python understands binary, but it needs Pillow to process images! ‚úÖ



#! We convert a Pillow image object back to binary for several reasons:

# 1Ô∏è‚É£ To Save or Download the Image
# Python and web apps (like Streamlit) handle downloads using binary data.
# A Pillow image object cannot be downloaded directly‚Äîit must first be converted into a binary format using BytesIO().




#! img.save(buf, format="PNG") does two things:

# Converts the Pillow image object (img) into binary format (so it can be stored or transferred).
# Specifies that the binary data should be saved in the PNG format.
